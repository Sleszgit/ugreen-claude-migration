PROJECT: LXC102 Backup Strategy
GOAL: Protect LXC102 (ugreen-ai-terminal) against data loss
SCOPE: Backup & recovery solution for months of configuration/scripting work

DECISION NEEDED:
1. Best backup method for LXC102? (vzdump, snapshots, rsync, tar+SSH?)
2. Optimal storage location? (homelab, UGREEN NAS, both?)
3. Frequency? (on-demand, daily, after changes?)
4. Recovery procedure & testing?

CONSTRAINTS:
- Can use homelab (192.168.40.40) or UGREEN NAS (/storage/Media)
- LXC102 is production system (active use)
- Need to preserve: scripts, configs, customizations, CLI tools, SSH keys
- Must be testable and have documented recovery

STORAGE OPTIONS:
- Homelab: Isolated, separate location, direct SSH access
- UGREEN NAS: Integrated, shared storage, high capacity

STATUS: Phase 1 - Research & Gemini consultation
