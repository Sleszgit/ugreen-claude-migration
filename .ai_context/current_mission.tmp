TASK: Diagnose rsync silent failure in Filmy920 Phase 2 transfer script

PROBLEM: Script runs successfully through STEP 5 (user confirmation prompt) but exits without starting actual transfer at STEP 6. When user enters "yes", the script immediately runs cleanup and exits.

SYMPTOM: Log shows "[INFO] STEP 6: Starting transfer..." immediately followed by "[INFO] Performing cleanup..." with NO rsync output or error message.

CONTEXT:
- Script: /mnt/lxc102scripts/transfers/filmy920-phase2-transfer.sh
- Execution: On homelab Proxmox host (192.168.40.40) as root
- Source: 920 NAS at 192.168.40.20:/volume2/Filmy920/Filmy920 (3.1TB, folders 2022-2025)
- Target: /WD10TB/Filmy920 on homelab (4.7TB available)
- Mount: /mnt/920-filmy920 (NFS v4, read-only)
- Attempts: 12+ different configurations, all fail at same point
- Rsync flags: -avh --progress --partial --stats --checksum --delete-after

REQUIRED ANALYSIS:
1. Why is rsync failing silently (error not captured in logs)?
2. What could cause rsync to fail specifically at line 243-250?
3. List all possible root causes in order of probability
4. Suggest debugging steps to identify exact failure point
5. Recommend code improvements to prevent this in future
